# Semantic Measures Library - ToolKit

The Semantic Measures Library Toolkit (SML-Toolkit) is a Java Toolkit dedicated to semantic measures computation and analysis.
Please visit the dedicated website for downloads or extra documentation http://www.semantic-measures-library.org

The SML-Toolkit is composed of various tools related to Semantic Similarity/Relatedness computation and analysis.
Those tools are provided through a common command-line interface.

The source code is written using Java 1.7 and the SML-Toolkit can therefore be used on any platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) in which Java is installed.

The project currently focuses on Semantic measures related to semantic graphs, e.g. between terms or concepts structured in a graph (ontology), between groups of concepts...
A package dedicated to String similarity measures is also provided but this is not currently the main concern of the project.
Contact me if you want to contribute. 

The excerpt of the documentation presented below is related to the tool dedicated to semantic similarity or relatedness computation.

## Semantic measures computation

Semantic measures computations are made through the SM tool (Semantic Measures tool).
The SM tool is a fast (multi-threads compatible) software solution which can be used to compute semantic measures.
For instance, this tool is used in our laboratory to compute billions of semantic measures scores (yes billions ;) in few hours. 


This tool can be used from the SML-Toolkit typing:

`java -jar sml-toolkit-<version> -t sm`

The last release of the toolkit can be downloaded at http://www.semantic-measures-library.org

The toolkit provides two command line interfaces to specify a configuration:
* **Profile configurations**: context specific interfaces which can be used to compute semantic measures for specific use cases, e.g. involving particular ontologies (the Gene Ontology, MesH) ...
* **Generic configuration**: Generic configuration through an XML file, this is a configuration mode for advanced users. It gives a low level access to the SML-Toolkit but can be not suited for practitionners which know few about semantic measures.

We briefly present the *profile configurations* available.

---------------------------------------
### Profile Configurations
---------------------------------------

*Profiles are supported since the 0.0.6 version of the SML-Toolkit.*

Profiles provide easy-to-use command-line interfaces for specific contexts of use, e.g. to compute semantic similarity between genes (products) annotated by Gene Ontology terms.
Indeed, the generic configuration which can be made through the XML interface requires complex configuration files to be specified and is therefore not suited for most practionners.

To ease the use of the SML-Toolkit, specific profiles (or command-line interfaces) have been developped to wrap the generic configuration mode into domain specific layers.
Those profiles aim at generating XML configuration files from command-line parameters.
Such a configuration mode is therefore particularly adapted for users which are not experts of semantic measures and/or those only interested on a easy-to-use command line tool (not a geeky and complex tool ;).

Various profiles are supported by the SML-Toolkit.
Below, the list of contexts of use for which a profile is/will be provided:
* Graph-Based Semantic Similarity or Relatedness
	* **Gene Ontology**, This profile can be used to compute semantic measure scores between Gene Ontology terms or gene products annotated by Gene Ontology terms. See dedicated section above.
	* **MeSH**, the profile dedicated to the MeSH. Planned for the next releases
	* **SnomedCT**. Planned for the next releases
	* **WordNet**. Planned for the next releases
	* **Disease Ontology**. Planned for the next releases
	* **Yago**. Planned for the next releases
	* **OBO**, the general profile dedicated to the OBO Ontologies. Planned for the next releases
	* **RDF**, the general profile dedicated to the ontologies expressed in RDF. Planned for the next releases

This profile is dedicated to the Gene Ontology (GO).
It can be used to compute semantic measures scores between GO terms or gene products annotated by GO terms.
The Gene Ontology must be in OBO format (version 1.2), the gene products annotations must be in GAF2 format or TSV (Tabulated Separated Values, an example is provided below).
The Gene Ontology and associated annotations can be downloaded at http://www.geneontology.org/

Please post a message to http://semantic-measures-library.org if you encounter any troubles or if you have any questions.
More information and documentation can also be found on the website. 

Below the parameters which can be used, command-line examples are also provided:

##### Parameters

This file must contain the pairs of GO term or gene product ids separated by tabs (required). 
When similarities between gene products are computed, the ids are the values specified in the second column of the GAF2 file specifying the annotations of the gene products. An example is provided above.

* `-output <file path>` output file in which the results will be flushed (required).

* `-mtype <type>` the type of semantic measures you want to use:

	* `BP` - Biological Process
	* `CC` - Cellular Component
	* `GLOBAL` - the three aspects MF-BP-CC will be used using a virtual root between the three		
	When a groupwise measure is used, all gene products' annotations not related to the aspect selected will not be considered. 
	Accepted values [MF,BP,CC,GLOBAL], default `BP`. example  `-aspect MF`.

		
* `-notfound <flag>` defines the behavior of the program if an entry element of the query file cannot be found, (i) in pairwise measures: one of the two GO terms cannot be found, (ii) in groupwise measures: one of the two gene products cannot be found. Accepted values [exclude, stop, set=<value>]:
	* `exclude` the entry will not be processed (a message will be logged if `-quiet` is not used)
	* `stop`    the program will stop
	* `set=<numerical value>` the entry will not be processed and the given value will be set as score (a message will be logged if `-quiet` is not used)
	default value = 'exclude'. Note that Gene products which are not annotated by at least one GO term of the selected aspect is removed and will therefore not be found despite it was defined in the annotation file. 

			
* `-noannots <flag>` defines the behavior if a gene product of the query file doesn't have any annotation (GO terms). Accepted values [exclude,stop, set=<value>]:
	* `exclude` the entry will not be processed (a message will be logged if -quiet is not used)
	* `stop`    the program will stop
	* `set=<numerical value>` the entry will not be processed and the given value will be set as score (a message will be logged if -quiet is not used)
	default value = 'set=-1' the score is set to -1.

			
* `-filter <params>` this parameter can be used to filter the GO terms associated to a gene product when the provided annotation file is in GAF2 format.
	* `noEC=<evidence_codes>` evidence codes to exclude separated by commas e.g. `EC=IEA` IEA annotations will not be considered
	* `Taxon=<taxon_ids>` taxon ids separated by commas e.g. `Taxon=9696` to only consider annotations associated to Taxon 9696
	Use `:` as separator between `noEC` and `Taxon` if any is required.
	Example of value `-filter noEC=IEA:Taxon=9696,5454`.
	Default value no filter.


* `-pm <flag>` a String value defining the pairwise measure to use. See the list of available measures below (required for pairwise measures or indirect groupwise measures).


* `-gm <flag>` a String value defining the direct groupwise measure or aggregation method (if an indirect groupwise measure must be used). See the list of available measures below (required for groupwise measures).


* `-ic <flag>` a String value defining the Information Content method to use (required by some measures). See the list of IC available below. 


* `-quiet` do not show warning messages

* `-notrgo` do not perform a transitive reduction of the GO


* `-notrannots` do not remove annotation redundancies i.e. if a gene product is annotated by two GO terms {X,Y} and X is subsumed by Y in the GO, the GO term Y will be removed from the annotations.

* `-threads` Integer defining the number of threads to use, i.e. processes allocates to the execution, default 1. Setting more threads reduce the execution time on large processes, suited configuration depends on your computer configuration, use with care if you don't get the implications in term of computational resources which will be used. Note also that results will not be ordered according to query file ordering.

##### Examples

###### Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology terms.

We compute the semantic similarity of each pair of GO terms specified in the query file `-queries`.
Those GO terms come from the Molecular function aspect of the Gene Ontology `-aspect MF`.
We use the measure proposed by Sclicker et al. and the Information content defined by Sanchez et al. (See the Semantic measures Library website for references).

```
java -jar sml-toolkit-<version>.jar -t sm -profile GO -go /data/go/eval/gene_ontology.1_2.obo -mtype p -queries /data/go/eval/input_query.tsv -output /tmp/test-sml.tsv -pm schlicker -ic sanchez -aspect MF
```

###### Semantic similarity between Gene products.

We compute the semantic similarity of each pair of gene products identifiers specified in the query file `-queries`.
The annotations are in GAF2 format. We exclude the annotations inferred electronically (IEA) `-filter noEC=IEA`
We only want to consider the Biological Process aspect of the Gene Ontology `-aspect BP`.
We use the measure proposed by Lin et al., the Information content defined by Resnik and the Best Match Average miwing strategy. (See the Semantic measures Library website for references).
If an entry contains no BP GO terms as annotations, it will not be found, we therefore set -1 as score `--notfound set=-1`.
Finally, we do not want the warnings to be shown `-quiet` and we allocate multiple threads to the process to reduce execution time `-treads 4` (use with care, i.e. `-treads 1`, if you don't understand the implications).

```
java -jar sml-toolkit-<version>.jar -t sm -profile GO -annots /data/go/eval/gene_association.goa_human -filter noEC=IEA --notfound set=-1  -go /data/go/eval/gene_ontology.1_2.obo -mtype g -queries /data/go/eval/input_query.tsv -output /tmp/test-sml.tsv -pm lin -ic resnik -gm bma -aspect BP -quiet -threads 4
```

##### Extra documentation

###### Query file
One line per entry.
An entry defines the two elements to compare (i.e. GO terms or gene products).
use a unique tab to separate the two ids.

```
GENE_ID_1 GENE_ID_2
GENE_ID_2 GENE_ID_3
GENE_ID_4 GENE_ID_1
...
```

```
GO_TERM1 GO_TERM2
GO_TERM3 GO_TERM2
GO_TERM4 GO_TERM2
...
```

###### Annotation in TSV format
One line per gene product, use a unique tab to separate the gene product id and the GO terms ids.
Two GO terms ids must be separated using a unique semicolon

```
GENE_ID_1 GO_TERM1;GO_TERM2;GO_TERM3
GENE_ID_2 GO_TERM1;GO_TERM3
...
```


####  MeSH: Semantic Measures
---------------------------------------

```
