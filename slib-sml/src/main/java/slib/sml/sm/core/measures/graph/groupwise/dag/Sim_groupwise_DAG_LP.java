 * Extract : For simLP the similarity measure is the depth of the longest shared
 * path from the root node. Two genes that are both quite specific and similar
 * should have long shared paths, while those that have less in common should
 * have relatively short shared paths.
 *
 * We understand the depth of the deepest lca of each entity couples.
