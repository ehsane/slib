 * Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence IJCAI (Vol. 1, pp. 448–453).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The IC of a concept u defined in a taxonomy is: -log(p(u)) with p(u) the
 * probability that the concept u occurs in a corpora or in an annotation
 * repository. The computation of the probability takes into account the
 * ordering of the concepts which is defined by the relation "rdfs:subClassOf".
 * In other words, if the concept u is subsumed by the concept v (i.e. u
 * rdfs:subClassOf v), any occurrence of the concept u is also an occurrence of
 * the concept v.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to avoid error i.e. -log(0) an occurrence is systematically
 * associated to all the leaf concepts specified in the taxonomy. A leaf concept
 * is a concept which does not subsumes any concept.
